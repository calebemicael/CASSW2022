Thus, virtual platforms users can develop software or firmware flexibly, without a hardware target, and with deployment quality. The performance and the flexibility originate from just-in-time translation engines and high-level models (i.e., programmer's view). Consequently, microarchitectural components are largely abstracted or simplified. In this circumstance, understanding the trade-offs of virtual platforms is just as important as creating your applications or experiments. By carefully studying the target problem, it's possible to speed up investigations in several orders of magnitude without losing the correlation with actual hardware execution. 
I try to leverage my eight years of working with virtual platforms through several different projects in this talk to explain trade-offs and use cases.</p><br> <p><b>Short Bio:</b><br>Felipe was born in Porto Alegre in the southernmost Brazilian state, Rio Grande do Sul. He holds a PhD in microelectronics and a Bachelor of Computer Engineering degree from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). Felipe participated in the BRAFITEC, studying in the B.Eng., Microelectronic and Automation, July 2012 to July 2013, at Ecole Polytechnique Universitaire de Montpellier. In parallel, He was an undergraduate research intern at the Laboratoire d'Informatique, de Robotique et de Microélectronique de Montpellier. In 2015, he was accepted to a one-year exchange at the University of Leicester at the post-graduate level (Engineering Departement). He researched the reliability of many-core embedded systems using virtual platforms. Additionally, during this period, he worked as Software Engineer at Imperas Software Ltd, incorporating performance estimation tools in its commercial engine. Felipe is currently a senior modelling engineer at Arm Cambridge, UK. His main work project includes system interconnections (e.g., CMN600, CI700) and platform integration such as Total Compute FVP.</p><br> <p>Session Chair: Dr. Leandro M. G.

In this talk, we will discuss the thermal challenges that NPUs bring, demonstrating how multiply-accumulate (MAC) arrays, which form the heart of any NPU, impose serious thermal bottlenecks to any on-chip systems due to their excessive power densities. We will also discuss how elevated temperatures severely degrade the reliability of on-chip memories, especially when it comes to emerging non-volatile memories, leading to bit errors in the neural network parameters (e.g., weights, activations, etc.). In this talk, we will also discuss: 1) the effectiveness of precision scaling and frequency scaling (FS) in temperature reductions for NPUs and 2) how advanced on-chip cooling using superlattice thin-film thermoelectric (TE) open doors for new tradeoffs between temperature, throughput, cooling cost, and inference accuracy in NPU chips.</p><br> <p><b>Short Bio:</b><br> Dr. Hussam Amrouch is a Junior Professor at the University of Stuttgart heading the Chair of Semiconductor Test and Reliability (STAR) as well as a Research Group Leader at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany.

A Brief Journey through the Promises and Progress of this Design Paradigm </h3> <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>The need for energy efficiency across the entire computing spectrum, from the Internet-of-Things to the High-Performance Computing, is motivating the emergence of newer devices, architectures, and design techniques. In the last decade, approximate computing has appeared as a design paradigm for applications that present an inherent tolerance to errors in their computations. By reducing the accuracy of the results, energy savings can be achieved in many modern applications, from image and video processing to machine learning and scientific computing. In this presentation, we will briefly walk through the fundamentals of this paradigm and we will explore some of its promises and progress achieved so far.</p><br> <p><b>Short Bio:</b><br>Dr.-Ing.

NO WEIGHTS!</h3> <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>Mainstream artificial neural network models are based on weighted-sum-and-threshold artificial neurons, as the pioneering Threshold Logic Unit, of McCullogh and Pitts. In this classic model, an important simplification happens in the way inputs to neuron are modeled: all synaptic connections terminate directly at the neuron’s soma. In fact, the vast majority of synapses in the central nervous system terminate at the neuron’s dendritic tree, the most noticeable morphological structure of the neuron cell. Mimicking biological neurons by focusing on the excitatory/inhibitory decoding performed by the dendritic trees is a different and attractive alternative to the integrate-and-fire McCullogh-Pitts neuron stylisation. It is now more than 60 years that Random Access Memory (RAM) nodes can play the role of artificial neurons that are addressed by Boolean inputs and produce Boolean outputs. The weightless neural network (WNN) approach has an implicit inspiration in the decoding process observed in the dendritic trees of biological neurons. An overview on recent theoretical advances and applications of weightless neural systems, in classification, clustering, regression, etc, is presented here.</p><br> <p><b>Short Bio:</b><br>Felipe França is Electronics Engineer from Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (1982), M.Sc. in Computer Science from Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (1987) and Ph.D. in Neural Systems Engineering from Imperial College of Science Technology And Medicine (1994).

Friedman - University of Rochester, USA</span> <br>Distributed On-Chip Power Delivery for Heterogeneous Nanoscale Integrated Systems</h3> <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>The focus of this presentation is on the fundamental challenges in delivering power to high speed, high complexity, heterogeneous integrated circuits. The efficient generation and distribution of multiple on-chip power supplies require fundamental changes to the power delivery process to provide increased, current to next-generation nanoscale heterogeneous integrated systems.
The delivery of high quality power to the on-chip circuitry with minimal energy loss is a fundamental objective of all modern integrated circuits. To supply sufficient on-chip power, a higher unregulated DC voltage is usually stepped down and regulated within the power delivery system. Power conversion and regulation resources should be efficiently managed to supply high quality power with minimal energy losses across multiple on-chip power domains. The design complexity of a power delivery system increases with greater requirements on the quality of the power supply, limitations of the passive elements, increasing board and package parasitic impedances, and limited number of I/O pins. To satisfy challenging power efficiency and regulation requirements, hundreds of power regulators should be co-designed with the many thousands of decoupling capacitors, distributing the power locally to many billions of on-chip loads.
Four primary components are required to realize an efficient on-chip power delivery system: (a) ultra-small voltage converters to generate power close to the load, (b) accurate models to characterize the individual power components, (c) efficient algorithms to manage the quality of the power delivered to the load circuits, and (d) a co-design methodology to simultaneously determine the optimal location of the on-chip power supplies and decoupling capacitors.
Several regulators as a point-of-load power supply for next generation heterogeneous systems are described. The area of these circuits is significantly smaller than conventional voltage regulators, while maintaining high current efficiency. The proposed circuits provide an adaptive means for distributing multiple local power supplies across an integrated circuit. Another important challenge in the realization of effective power delivery systems is the analysis of highly complex mesh structured power grids where individual voltage fluctuations at billions of nodes need to be efficiently and accurately determined. Closed-form expressions for the effective resistance between these nodes will be described. This effective resistance model is utilized in the development of a non-iterative analysis algorithm to compute the node voltages. This algorithm drastically lowers computational complexity to determine IR drop and L di/dt noise.
With the introduction of ultra-small on-chip voltage regulators, design methodologies are needed to determine the location of the on-chip power supplies and decoupling capacitors. A codesign methodology is presented to simultaneously determine the optimal location of the power supplies and decoupling capacitors within high performance power delivery networks. The effects of the size, number, and location of the power supplies and decoupling capacitors on the power noise are also discussed.
These circuits, algorithms, and design methods will fundamentally change the manner in which power is delivered on-chip, producing a more efficient methodology for generating, distributing, and managing power to the many billions of devices within a high performance heterogeneous integrated system.</p><br> <p><b>Short Bio:</b><br>Dr. Friedman received the B.S. degree from Lafayette College in 1979, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Irvine, in 1981 and 1989, respectively, all in electrical engineering.

We will, however, stray from the well beaten path of analog-AI. We explore integrated-circuit (IC) based analog computers for radio-frequency (RF) computation of partial differential equation (PDE) systems aimed at computationally expensive classical physics problems. Unlike AI problems, which mostly reduce to matrix-vector multiplications followed by nonlinear functions, the solution of various types of linear and nonlinear PDE systems relevant for classical physics simulations pose challenging problems for the analog computer architect. We explore algorithms aimed at solving a particular class of linear PDE system encountered in computational electromagnetics. The derivation starts from Maxwell’s equations, which describe the behavior of linear electromagnetics at any frequency, and lead to two classes of analog computers that compute Maxwell’s equations in a spatio-temporal grid. We provide examples of real-world analog-CMOS chip implementations of both discrete-time (switched capacitor) and continuous-time solvers using some of the fastest and most energy efficient analog computers ICs ever designed. Our early prototype analog CMOS computer chip was fabricated using TSMC 180nm CMOS technology, and shows more than 400x speed improvement at 1000x less power compared to state-of-art GPU implementations of an electromagnetic wave-equation model. We hasten to add that these massive gains come at the cost of losing the advantages of programmability and ease of use for which  GPUs are quite popular, not to mention real challenges with thermal noise, distortion, and need for precise calibration of analog compute units; after all, there is no such thing as a free lunch!  Nevertheless, measured results from our CMOS chip seem to validate the hypothesis that specialized analog computers can be both fast, accurate, and energy efficient at certain types of computational problems relevant to physics simulations. The talk ends with a brief discussion of ongoing work on analog CMOS computers for highly-nonlinear PDEs that describe acoustic pressure waves. The work is sponsored  by the Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) through a subcontract from Ocius Technologies.</p><br> <p><b>Short Bio:</b><br>Dr. Arjuna Madanayake is an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Florida International University (FIU) located in Miami, Florida, USA.

The presented approach is applicable to any technical problem, where simulation is used to map a set of parameters onto a set of performance feature and where simulation is expensive. This requires careful optimization with minimum number of simulations. Instead of circuit macromodeling or response surface modeling for performance evaluation, the approach works immediately on simulation. Instead of statistical methods like Monte-Carlo, a deterministic approach is presented for the yield analysis. The approach is based on the principle of “point of highest probability (density) to violate the specification”.
