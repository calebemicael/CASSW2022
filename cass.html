        <p>The IEEE Circuits and Systems Society is the leading organization that promotes the advancement of the
          theory, analysis, computer-aided design and practical implementation of circuits, and the application of
          circuit theoretic techniques to systems and signal processing. The Society brings engineers, researchers,
          scientists and others involved in circuits and systems applications access to the industry’s most essential
          technical information, networking opportunities, career development tools, and many other exclusive benefits.
          Members with similar technical interests engage in professional exchange through the Society’s more than 100
          local chapters in the United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Asia, Australia,
          and the Pacific.</p>
        <p>Membership includes Society Newsletter (electronic), IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine (electronic and
          print), IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal (electronic), IEEE Circuits and Systems Society Digital Library, and
          Conference Digital Library (electronic).</p>
        <p>Circuits and Systems Society membership covers one calendar year, beginning on 1 January and ending on 31
          December. Professionals can join at any time during the calendar year and fees are prorated based on the month
          in which membership begins through the end of the calendar year. The cost of membership includes Society dues

        <ul>
          <li>Student member: IEEE (USD 27,00) + CASS (USD 18,00) = USD 45,00 per year</li>
          <li>Professional member: IEEE (USD 84,00 - electronic option) + CASS (USD 29,00) = USD 113,00 per year</;>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>As an IEEE Member, you can affiliate with the Council on Electronic Design Automation (CEDA) free of charge.
