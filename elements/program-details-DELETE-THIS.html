        <h3> <span style="color:#39C0F0">Felipe Rosa - ARM, UK</span> <br>Using Virtual Platforms accelerate
          research and software development</h3>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>Virtual platforms provide full-system emulation of hardware components and
          running at speeds comparable to the actual hardware. Thus, virtual platforms users can develop
          software or firmware flexibly, without a hardware target, and with deployment quality. The performance
          and the flexibility originate from just-in-time translation engines and high-level models (i.e.,
          programmer's view). Consequently, microarchitectural components are largely abstracted or simplified.
          In this circumstance, understanding the trade-offs of virtual platforms is just as important as
          creating your applications or experiments. By carefully studying the target problem, it's possible to
          speed up investigations in several orders of magnitude without losing the correlation with actual
          hardware execution.
          I try to leverage my eight years of working with virtual platforms through several different projects
          in this talk to explain trade-offs and use cases.</p><br>

          Temperature: The Unseen Enemy for Neural Processing Units</h3>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>Neural processing units (NPUs) are becoming an integral part in all modern
          computing systems due to their substantial role in accelerating neural networks. In this talk, we will
          discuss the thermal challenges that NPUs bring, demonstrating how multiply-accumulate (MAC) arrays,
          which form the heart of any NPU, impose serious thermal bottlenecks to any on-chip systems due to
          their excessive power densities. We will also discuss how elevated temperatures severely degrade the
          reliability of on-chip memories, especially when it comes to emerging non-volatile memories, leading
          to bit errors in the neural network parameters (e.g., weights, activations, etc.). In this talk, we
          will also discuss: 1) the effectiveness of precision scaling and frequency scaling (FS) in temperature
          reductions for NPUs and 2) how advanced on-chip cooling using superlattice thin-film thermoelectric
          (TE) open doors for new tradeoffs between temperature, throughput, cooling cost, and inference
          accuracy in NPU chips.</p><br>

        <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>The need for energy efficiency across the entire computing spectrum, from the

          By reducing the accuracy of the results, energy savings can be achieved in many modern applications,
          from image and video processing to machine learning and scientific computing. In this presentation, we

          <br>Weightless Neural Networks: LOOK MUM! NO WEIGHTS!
        </h3>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>Mainstream artificial neural network models are based on
          weighted-sum-and-threshold artificial neurons, as the pioneering Threshold Logic Unit, of McCullogh
          and Pitts. In this classic model, an important simplification happens in the way inputs to neuron are
          modeled: all synaptic connections terminate directly at the neuron’s soma. In fact, the vast majority
          of synapses in the central nervous system terminate at the neuron’s dendritic tree, the most
          noticeable morphological structure of the neuron cell. Mimicking biological neurons by focusing on the
          excitatory/inhibitory decoding performed by the dendritic trees is a different and attractive
          alternative to the integrate-and-fire McCullogh-Pitts neuron stylisation. It is now more than 60 years
          that Random Access Memory (RAM) nodes can play the role of artificial neurons that are addressed by
          Boolean inputs and produce Boolean outputs. The weightless neural network (WNN) approach has an
          implicit inspiration in the decoding process observed in the dendritic trees of biological neurons. An
          overview on recent theoretical advances and applications of weightless neural systems, in
          classification, clustering, regression, etc, is presented here.</p><br>

          On-Chip Power Delivery for Heterogeneous Nanoscale Integrated Systems</h3>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>The focus of this presentation is on the fundamental challenges in delivering
          power to high speed, high complexity, heterogeneous integrated circuits. The efficient generation and
          distribution of multiple on-chip power supplies require fundamental changes to the power delivery
          process to provide increased, current to next-generation nanoscale heterogeneous integrated systems.
          The delivery of high quality power to the on-chip circuitry with minimal energy loss is a fundamental
          objective of all modern integrated circuits. To supply sufficient on-chip power, a higher unregulated
          DC voltage is usually stepped down and regulated within the power delivery system. Power conversion
          and regulation resources should be efficiently managed to supply high quality power with minimal
          energy losses across multiple on-chip power domains. The design complexity of a power delivery system
          increases with greater requirements on the quality of the power supply, limitations of the passive
          elements, increasing board and package parasitic impedances, and limited number of I/O pins. To
          satisfy challenging power efficiency and regulation requirements, hundreds of power regulators should
          be co-designed with the many thousands of decoupling capacitors, distributing the power locally to
          many billions of on-chip loads.
          Four primary components are required to realize an efficient on-chip power delivery system: (a)
          ultra-small voltage converters to generate power close to the load, (b) accurate models to
          characterize the individual power components, (c) efficient algorithms to manage the quality of the
          power delivered to the load circuits, and (d) a co-design methodology to simultaneously determine the
          optimal location of the on-chip power supplies and decoupling capacitors.
          Several regulators as a point-of-load power supply for next generation heterogeneous systems are
          described. The area of these circuits is significantly smaller than conventional voltage regulators,
          while maintaining high current efficiency. The proposed circuits provide an adaptive means for
          distributing multiple local power supplies across an integrated circuit. Another important challenge
          in the realization of effective power delivery systems is the analysis of highly complex mesh
          structured power grids where individual voltage fluctuations at billions of nodes need to be
          efficiently and accurately determined. Closed-form expressions for the effective resistance between
          these nodes will be described. This effective resistance model is utilized in the development of a
          non-iterative analysis algorithm to compute the node voltages. This algorithm drastically lowers
          computational complexity to determine IR drop and L di/dt noise.
          With the introduction of ultra-small on-chip voltage regulators, design methodologies are needed to
          determine the location of the on-chip power supplies and decoupling capacitors. A codesign methodology
          is presented to simultaneously determine the optimal location of the power supplies and decoupling
          capacitors within high performance power delivery networks. The effects of the size, number, and
          location of the power supplies and decoupling capacitors on the power noise are also discussed.
          These circuits, algorithms, and design methods will fundamentally change the manner in which power is
          delivered on-chip, producing a more efficient methodology for generating, distributing, and managing
          power to the many billions of devices within a high performance heterogeneous integrated system.</p>

        <h3> <span style="color:#39C0F0">Arjuna Madanayake - Florida International University, USA</span> <br>An
          Emerging Age of Analog-Accelerated Computing</h3>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>Analog Computers are experiencing a come-back with lots of interest from the AI
          community through modern concepts such as in-memory computing and spiking neural networks. We will,
          however, stray from the well beaten path of analog-AI. We explore integrated-circuit (IC) based analog
          computers for radio-frequency (RF) computation of partial differential equation (PDE) systems aimed at
          computationally expensive classical physics problems. Unlike AI problems, which mostly reduce to
          matrix-vector multiplications followed by nonlinear functions, the solution of various types of linear
          and nonlinear PDE systems relevant for classical physics simulations pose challenging problems for the
          analog computer architect. We explore algorithms aimed at solving a particular class of linear PDE
          system encountered in computational electromagnetics. The derivation starts from Maxwell’s equations,
          which describe the behavior of linear electromagnetics at any frequency, and lead to two classes of
          analog computers that compute Maxwell’s equations in a spatio-temporal grid. We provide examples of
          real-world analog-CMOS chip implementations of both discrete-time (switched capacitor) and
          continuous-time solvers using some of the fastest and most energy efficient analog computers ICs ever
          designed. Our early prototype analog CMOS computer chip was fabricated using TSMC 180nm CMOS
          technology, and shows more than 400x speed improvement at 1000x less power compared to state-of-art
          GPU implementations of an electromagnetic wave-equation model. We hasten to add that these massive
          gains come at the cost of losing the advantages of programmability and ease of use for which GPUs are
          quite popular, not to mention real challenges with thermal noise, distortion, and need for precise
          calibration of analog compute units; after all, there is no such thing as a free lunch! Nevertheless,
          measured results from our CMOS chip seem to validate the hypothesis that specialized analog computers
          can be both fast, accurate, and energy efficient at certain types of computational problems relevant
          to physics simulations. The talk ends with a brief discussion of ongoing work on analog CMOS computers
          for highly-nonlinear PDEs that describe acoustic pressure waves. The work is sponsored by the Defense
          Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) through a subcontract

        <h3> <span style="color:#39C0F0">Helmut Graeb - TU Munich, Germany</span> <br>Circuit-Level Yield
          Analysis and Optimization – The Deterministic Way</h3>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>The talk will present a deterministic point of view on yield analysis and
          optimization on transistor level. The presented approach is applicable to any technical problem, where
          simulation is used to map a set of parameters onto a set of performance feature and where simulation
          is expensive. This requires careful optimization with minimum number of simulations. Instead of
          circuit macromodeling or response surface modeling for performance evaluation, the approach works
          immediately on simulation. Instead of statistical methods like Monte-Carlo, a deterministic approach
          is presented for the yield analysis. The approach is based on the principle of “point of highest
          probability (density) to violate the specification”. It will be illustrated with an analog circuit
          example.</p><br>
