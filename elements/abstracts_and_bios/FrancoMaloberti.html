        <h3> <span style="color:#39C0F0">Franco Maloberti - ARM, UK</span> <br>Using Virtual Platforms accelerate
          research and software development</h3>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>Virtual platforms provide full-system emulation of hardware components and
          running at speeds comparable to the actual hardware. Thus, virtual platforms users can develop
          software or firmware flexibly, without a hardware target, and with deployment quality. The performance
          and the flexibility originate from just-in-time translation engines and high-level models (i.e.,
          programmer's view). Consequently, microarchitectural components are largely abstracted or simplified.
          In this circumstance, understanding the trade-offs of virtual platforms is just as important as
          creating your applications or experiments. By carefully studying the target problem, it's possible to
          speed up investigations in several orders of magnitude without losing the correlation with actual
          hardware execution.
          I try to leverage my eight years of working with virtual platforms through several different projects
          in this talk to explain trade-offs and use cases.</p><br>
        <p><b>Short Bio:</b><br>Felipe was born in Porto Alegre in the southernmost Brazilian state, Rio Grande
          do Sul. He holds a PhD in microelectronics and a Bachelor of Computer Engineering degree from the
          Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). Felipe participated in the BRAFITEC, studying in the
          B.Eng., Microelectronic and Automation, July 2012 to July 2013, at Ecole Polytechnique Universitaire
          de Montpellier. In parallel, He was an undergraduate research intern at the Laboratoire
          d'Informatique, de Robotique et de Micro√©lectronique de Montpellier. In 2015, he was accepted to a
          one-year exchange at the University of Leicester at the post-graduate level (Engineering Departement).
          He researched the reliability of many-core embedded systems using virtual platforms. Additionally,
          during this period, he worked as Software Engineer at Imperas Software Ltd, incorporating performance
          estimation tools in its commercial engine. Felipe is currently a senior modelling engineer at Arm
          Cambridge, UK. His main work project includes system interconnections (e.g., CMN600, CI700) and
          platform integration such as Total Compute FVP.</p><br>
